# Meteorite Landings: A Visual Data-Driven Exploration

This project investigates global meteorite landings using a comprehensive dataset of 34,513 entries compiled by The Meteoritical Society. Through data cleaning and interactive Tableau visualizations, we uncover insights into meteorite classifications, mass distributions, spatial hotspots, and temporal patterns.

## 🧠 Objective
To use visual analytics to identify meaningful trends and patterns in meteorite landing data—helping answer scientific questions about their origins, types, and geographical impact zones.

## 🌍 Dataset Overview
- Source: The Meteoritical Society
- Records: 34,513
- Features include:
  - Name, ID, Class, Mass
  - Latitude & Longitude
  - Fall Type: Observed vs. Discovered
  - Year of Fall or Discovery

## 📊 Key Visualizations

1. **World Map of Meteorite Landings**  
   - Pinpointed geographical clusters and landing hotspots

2. **Bar Chart of Meteorite Classifications**  
   - Displayed the most frequently found types on Earth

3. **Mass vs. Classification Scatter Plot**  
   - Examined size variations across meteorite types

4. **Temporal Line Chart**  
   - Showed yearly trends of meteorite falls and discoveries

5. **Fall Type Breakdown**  
   - Compared the proportion of 'Observed' vs. 'Discovered' meteorites

## 🔍 Insights
- Meteorite discoveries are geographically clustered—likely due to environmental and observational factors.
- Some meteorite types show a tendency toward higher or lower masses.
- Temporal spikes in recorded landings could be correlated with meteor showers or observational advancements.
- The majority of modern discoveries are categorized as “discovered,” highlighting detection biases over time.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Inconsistent data availability for some team members
- Visual troubleshooting and Tableau formatting
- Collaboration across time zones and summer schedules

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Tableau (primary visualization tool)
- Python & Excel (for data cleaning and preprocessing)

## 👥 Team
- Rohit Kamineni  
- [Add teammates if applicable]

## 📌 Takeaway
This project demonstrates how visual analytics can transform complex scientific data into meaningful, intuitive insights—despite challenges in data consistency and remote collaboration.
